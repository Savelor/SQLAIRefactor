## Avoiding cursors

The inefficiency of cursors is a classic pain point in SQL Server performance. Cursors allow you to iterate through rows one by one, similar to a loop in procedural languages. While this might feel intuitive for developers coming from imperative programming backgrounds, cursors are usually inefficient for several reasons:
Row-by-row processing: SQL Server is optimized for set-based operations. Cursors break this model.
Resource intensive: They require memory and locks, and often spill to tempdb.
Slow performance: For large result sets, performance degrades dramatically compared to set-based
You can often refactor cursor-based code by rewriting it without explicitly defining a cursor, relying instead on standard T-SQL constructs. Below are some common approaches.

**Set-Based Queries:** This approach is typically valid when the cursor is simple, meaning that it only reads rows from a query result, it performs operations that can be expressed as aggregations, joins, or window functions, it does not depend on row-by-row side effects and the logic for one row does not depend on the state of previous iterations.

```sql
DECLARE @CustomerID INT, @OrderDate DATE, @TotalDue MONEY, @PrevCustomerID INT = NULL, @RunningTotal MONEY = 0;

DECLARE @Results TABLE ( CustomerID INT, OrderDate DATE, TotalDue MONEY, RunningTotal MONEY);

DECLARE order_cursor CURSOR FOR
    SELECT CustomerID, OrderDate, SubTotal AS TotalDue
    FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader
    WHERE SubTotal > 1000
    ORDER BY CustomerID, OrderDate;

OPEN order_cursor;
FETCH NEXT FROM order_cursor INTO @CustomerID, @OrderDate, @TotalDue;

WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
BEGIN
    IF @CustomerID <> @PrevCustomerID
        SET @RunningTotal = 0; -- reset when customer changes

    SET @RunningTotal += @TotalDue;

    INSERT INTO @Results (CustomerID, OrderDate, TotalDue, RunningTotal)
    VALUES (@CustomerID, @OrderDate, @TotalDue, @RunningTotal);

    SET @PrevCustomerID = @CustomerID;
    FETCH NEXT FROM order_cursor INTO @CustomerID, @OrderDate, @TotalDue;
END;

CLOSE order_cursor;
DEALLOCATE order_cursor;

-- Return result set
SELECT * FROM @Results;
```
--Refactore version:
```sql
SELECT  CustomerID, OrderDate, SubTotal AS TotalDue,
    SUM(SubTotal) OVER (
        PARTITION BY CustomerID
        ORDER BY OrderDate
        ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
    ) AS RunningTotal
FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader
WHERE SubTotal > 1000
ORDER BY CustomerID, OrderDate;
```

**CTE:** In general, a cursor can be rewritten as a CTE when the cursorâ€™s purpose is primarily row sequencing, grouping, or computing derived columns rather than performing complex procedural operations per row.  The cursor should not perform row-by-row external actions, and the logic for each iteration should not depend on the results of previous iterations.

**WHILE loop:** a cursor can often be rewritten as a WHILE loop when the goal is to process a fixed set of rows row by row. This approach works best when the data can be stored in a temporary table or table variable, allowing the loop to iterate over each row using a key or sequential index. WHILE loops are particularly useful when you need procedural logic or the ability to exit early with a BREAK statement.
